# Routing Algorithm for Ocean Shipping and Urban Deliveries
On this project for DA Curricular Unit, we were suggested to analyse the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and design heuristics to solve it, using several datasets from the context of ocean shipping and urban deliveries.

The goal of this project was twofold. First, it was implemented a basic exhaustive approach for the classic routing problem using the TSP abstraction, therefore learning first-hand that although such an approach can find optimal solutions, its applicability is restricted to very small graphs. Second, our critical thinking skills were refined, by developing and analysing a set of approximate solutions to the TSP and developing our own heuristics.

The dataset consists of 3 graph types: Toy Graphs (small size), Medium-Size Graphs and Real-world Graphs (large size).
